The test/unit directory contains unit tests for Scintilla data structures.

The tests can be run on Windows or Linux using g++ and GNU make.
The Google Test framework is used.
http://code.google.com/p/googletest/

Google test must be installed first.
On Linux, install the google test packages libgtest-dev and libgtest0.
On Windows download Google test and install it as a peer to the directory
containing scintilla. The makefile assumes it is in ../../../../gtest-1.5.0.

To run the tests:
make
./unitTest
